title: Welcome to my blog

Today I went to work. The chef was super nice. He was makinga an effort to make me feel welcomed, trying to be friendly with me, which is sweet. I always appreciate how the chefs treat part-timers at my workplace. I hope they can also manage their own mental and physical health because chefs work long hours and are always understaffed.
